# Module 11 Challenge: Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we scrape data from two sources related to Mars: Mars news articles and Mars weather data. We use automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to extract the required information. Then, we organize, analyze, and visualize the data to gain insights into Mars.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text
- Utilized automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site.
- Extracted HTML code and information using Beautiful Soup.
- Scraped titles and preview text of news articles.
- Stored the scraped data in a list of dictionaries.

## Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
- Inspected the page and identified elements to scrape.
- Scraped the data from the HTML table using Beautiful Soup.
- Assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with correct headings and data types.
- Analyzed the dataset to answer various questions related to Mars weather.
- Visualized the analyzed data with appropriate plots to support the answers.
- Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.
